# BCM43224 WiFi driver (lab)

LeanOS drives the Qotom's Broadcom BCM43224 (PCI `14e4:4353`, D11 core rev 23,
N-PHY rev 6, radio 2056 rev 11) with device programs written in Lean. The lab
kernel cannot run allocating Lean code, so the driver is expressed in a small
register-machine instruction set (`LeanOS/Wifi/Bytecode.lean`); a hosted
generator (`lake exe leanos-wifi-gen`) encodes a program and a runtime-free C
executor (`hardware/wifi/wifi-exec.h`) performs only the effects each
instruction names: MMIO, configuration space, delays, scratch memory, FIFOs
and serial records.

| Layer | Modules |
|---|---|
| Machine, simulator | `Bytecode`, `Sim` |
| Chip bring-up, microcode | `Bcm43224` |
| N-PHY and radio (brcmsmac port, ISC) | `NPhy`, `NPhyTables`, `NPhyTablesData`, `NPhyWorkarounds`, `Radio2056`, `NPhyInit` |
| MAC receive/transmit, TX descriptors, power | `Mac`, `Tx` |
| Station management, handshake, DHCP | `Mlme`, `Handshake`, `DevCrypto`, `DevCcmp`, `DevDhcp`, `Connect` |
| Reference protocol library (hosted) | `Bytes`, `Sha1`, `Pbkdf2`, `Aes`, `Eapol`, `Ieee80211`, `Dhcp` |

Frames move by programmed I/O (RX direct-FIFO mode, PIO TX), so no DMA engine
is started. Device crypto is checked against the reference library in the
simulator (`leanos-wifi-devcrypto`, `leanos-wifi-devccmp`,
`leanos-wifi-hssim`, `leanos-wifi-dhcpsim`) and the simulator against the C
executor (`leanos-wifi-xcheck`); the reference library passes published
vectors (`leanos-wifi-vectors`).

Development runs from FreeBSD userland with `hardware/wifi/fbsd-runner.c`
(`/dev/mem`, `/dev/pci`); the same program image is spliced into the lab
kernel with `scripts/build-qotom-recovery-lab.py --wifi-program` and installed
by `hardware/wifi/install-lab.sh`. Hardware observations:
`hardware/lab/observations/qotom-wifi-scan-20260926` and
`qotom-wifi-connect-20260926`.

Program images for `connect` embed the network PMK (from `LEANOS_WIFI_PSK`)
and must never be committed. Known gaps: calibrations are not ported, the
PMU spur-avoid PLL update is replaced by `SPURAVOID_DISABLE`, the SNonce comes
from timer jitter, and nothing beyond DHCP (ARP, IP traffic, rekeying) runs.
